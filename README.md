## Intro 
"STRIKE A POSE!" is an interactive, motion-controlled videogame.   

It's a fun workout challenge using body pose classification, in which to follow along with various exercises:   
From squats to standing, hiding, making an X, or striking a unique pose of your own, you'll work up a sweat! 🏋️   

You have the flexibility to adjust the number of rounds and the time between poses for an extra challenge.    

Data collection, model training, and the game script are modularized, making it easy to customize to meet your unique workout needs. 💪

### Installation / Deinstallation

To get started with "STRIKE A POSE!", follow these steps:

1. Clone this Git repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alx-sch/STRIKE_A_POSE_Body_Pose_Classification_Game.git
   cd STRIKE_A_POSE_Body_Pose_Classification_Game
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment for better isolation of dependencies:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv strike_a_pose_env
    source strike_a_pose_env/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the game-specific requirements:
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Run the Game!    
    Start the game by specifying the number of rounds and the time between poses (in seconds).    
    
    ```bash
    python play.py <NUMBER_OF_ROUNDS> <SECONDS_BETWEEN_POSES>
    ```

    **Example:** `python play.py 10 5`

**Post-Game Commands**

5.  Exit the environment          
    When you are done playing, but want to keep the game installed for later:
    
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

6.  Re-Run the Game          
    To play again later (after running step 5), navigate back to the game directory and re-activate the environment:     
    
    ```bash
    source strike_a_pose_env/bin/activate
python play.py <NUMBER_OF_ROUNDS> <SECONDS_BETWEEN_POSES>
    ```

7.  Deinstallation  
    To completely remove the game, its environment, and free up disk space, run this command block while you are inside the game directory:
        
    ```bash
    deactivate 2>/dev/null  # Safely deactivates if active
    cd ..
    rm -rf STRIKE_A_POSE_Body_Pose_Classification_Game
    ``` 

### How to Play
To enjoy "STRIKE A POSE!", follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Start the game by specifying the number of rounds and the time between poses. For example:

   ```bash
   python play.py 10 5  # Start with 10 rounds and 5 seconds between poses

3. A window with a video feed will appear. Adjust your position and camera angle to fit the green square.
   
4. Controls:
  - Press the 'Space' key to start the countdown.
  - You can press 'R' to restart the script execution or 'Q' to quit the game

### Make it Yours!
Adjust the game to your needs! 💪     
Please refer to the documentation in collect_data.py, train_model.ipynb, and play.py for details.
- Collect training data of poses of your choice with **collect_data.py**.
- Train a new model to detect these new poses and evaluate the model's performance using **train_model.ipynb**. You are encouraged to explore and experiment with different model architectures.
- Adjust the model used, poses, and respective sound files (see [Audio Credits](#audio-credits)) in **play.py** to start your new Pose Game!
